The basic skeleton of a website is an HTML page. This HTML page is a text file with a certain
format. Taking advantage of this fact, one can take an HTML template and create multiple
pages with different values stored. This is exactly what we are going to do in this homework.
Many websites use these kinds of scripts to mass generate HTML pages from databases. We
will use a sample text file as our ‘database’.
Our goal will be to take a resume in a simplistic text file and convert it into an HTML file that
can be displayed by a web browser.
